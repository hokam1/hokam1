## Who am I?
As you can tell from the image, I obviously start fires.

But on a more serious note, I'm a software engineer! I specialise in writing open-sourced software for various companies and projects. 
My passion is making things easier to use, simpler and more widely accessible in the world. Much of my involvement lies within the
Discord bot development community, presiding under the alias of [@i0bs](https://github.com/i0bs).

If you'd like to learn more about me and the things I've created, please consider checking out my pinned repositories on that account!

## What do you do?
Currently, I'm a freelance worker. This account is used for work purposes to help separate my digital life from my real one. This account
has my real legal name and employment footprint.

### Tech stack
Curious about the programming languages and development tools I know? See them here!
